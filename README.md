#  [Moritz-Z] AutoPkg recipes
===============

Many of these recipes were created with the aid of [Recipe Robot](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot), an app you should definitely check out.

## Shared Processors

I wrote custom processors for my own recipes. Feel free to refer to them if you find them useful, or modify and redistribute as you like.

- __[App_Notification](SharedProcessors/README.md)__  
    This processor returns recipe_name, recipe_version and a previously defined personal message
